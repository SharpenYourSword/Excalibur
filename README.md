* First Blade: U.S. Christian American Constitutionally Supreme and Binding Primary Source per Founding Documents &; 

a) The U.S. American Declaration of Independence - July 4, 1776.

b) The U.S. American Bill of Rights - September 25, 1789.

c) The U.S. American Federal Constitution, "this Constitution" per U.S. Const. Amend. VI. - September 17, 1787.

d) Public Law 97-280 - "The Year of The Bible" e) U.S. American Federal Constitutional Supreme Court Ruling:
"The authentic exposition and interpretation of the law, which, binding every citizen, is free for publication to all, whether it is a declaration of a constitution or a statute." - Banks v. Manchester, 128 U.S. 244, (1888 ). f) "We hold that it does not. Over a century ago, we recognized a limitation on copyright protection for certain government work product, rooted in the Copyright Act's "authorship" requirement. Under what has been dubbed the government edicts doctrine, officials empowered to speak with the force of law cannot be the authors of-and therefore cannot copyright-the works they create in the course of their official duties.

We have previously applied that doctrine to hold that non-binding, explanatory legal materials are not copyrightable when created by judges who possess the authority to make and interpret the law. See Banks v. Manchester , 128 U.S. 244, 9 S.Ct. 36, 32 L.Ed. 425 (1888). We now recognize that the same logic applies to non-binding, explanatory legal materials created by a legislative body vested with the authority to make law. Because Georgia's annotations are authored by an arm of the legislature in the course of its legislative duties, the government edicts doctrine puts them outside the reach of copyright protection." - Georgia v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 140 S. Ct. 1498, 206 L. Ed. 2d 732 (2020). 

e) "Upon the State courts, equally with the courts of the Union, rests the obligation to guard, enforce, and protect every right granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States and the laws made in pursuance thereof, whenever those rights are involved in any suit or proceeding before them; for the judges of the State courts are required to take an oath to support that Constitution, and they are bound by it, and the laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made under their authority, as the supreme law of the land, "anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." If they fail therein, and withhold or deny rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, the party aggrieved may bring the case from the highest court of the State in which the question could be decided to this court for final and conclusive determination." - Robb v. Connolly, 111 U.S. 624, 637 (U.S. 1884).
